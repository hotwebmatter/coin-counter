# Coin Counter

Fourth programming exercise in Chapter 2 of textbook.

Not assigned in class, but I'm keeping up my GitHub streak.

Implementation of classic coin-counting algorithm (thanks, CS50.)

Demonstrates use of integer and floating-point division,
and use of modular arithmetic to calculate remainders.

## Example output
```
$ dotnet.exe bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/coin-counter.dll
 Change given: $0.92
     Quarters: 3
        Dimes: 1
      Nickels: 1
      Pennies: 2
```
